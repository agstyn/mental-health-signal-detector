#  Mental Health Signal Detector

AI-powered NLP model that detects **mental health signals from text** using a fine-tuned **DistilBERT transformer model**.

The project also includes **Explainable AI (SHAP)** to understand why the model makes predictions and an **interactive Streamlit web app**.

---

#  Features

* Transformer-based mental health text classification
* Fine-tuned **DistilBERT model**
* **Explainable AI with SHAP**
* Interactive **Streamlit web application**
* Real-time prediction with confidence score
* Human-friendly supportive responses

---

#  Model

The model is trained on mental health related text data and predicts the mental state signal.

Example signals detected:

* Anxiety
* Depression
* Stress
* Emotional distress
* Neutral / stable

---

#  Web Application

The Streamlit interface allows users to input text and receive:

* Predicted mental health signal
* Model confidence score
* Helpful supportive message

Example:

Input:

"I feel extremely anxious and stressed lately"

Output:

Prediction: Anxiety
Confidence: 0.88

Suggested message:

> It looks like you're going through stress or anxiety.
> Taking a short break, talking with someone you trust, or seeking support can help.

#  Explainable AI

The project uses **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)** to visualize:

* Which words influence the prediction
* How the model interprets emotional language

This improves transparency and trust in the model.
